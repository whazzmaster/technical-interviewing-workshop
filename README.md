# Technical Interviewing Workshop

_A repository of slides and materials about technical interviewing for a software engineering job._

## Usage

This repo does not necessarily need to be cloned to your local machine; the materials and slides can be read and viewed entirely on Github.

## About

This repository was originally created to support an in-person workshop at the University of Wisconsin-Madison for students graduating from Computer Science or similar departments and who are starting to interview with tech companies. The content is meant to support the workshop, but also may have value in a vacuum if you're also in the position to start interviewing for positions.

## Interviewing for Software Engineering Jobs
